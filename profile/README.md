# Katerina Artavanis-Tsakonas lab
Our laboratory is dedicated to understanding the cell biology of Plasmodium falciparum.

We are particularly interested in the pathways, evolution, and trafficking of this parasite - with a special focus on the ubiquitin pathway.

We have identified and characterized several de-ubiquitinated proteins in malaria, such as Uch37 and UchL3. De-ubiquitination is a process that removes ubiquitin, a small protein that can be attached to other proteins to regulate their function. We are investigating how de-ubiquitination functions in malaria and how it is regulated.

Our research aims to provide new insights into the biology of Plasmodium falciparum that can be used to develop new and improved strategies for malaria control and elimination.
