# Katerina Artavanis-Tsakonas lab
Our laboratory is dedicated to understanding the cell biology of Plasmodium falciparum.

Parasites have adapted intricate mechanisms of avoiding host immune responses, limiting tissue damage, and modulating their immediate surrounding to support their presence.

We aim to understand how they adapt themselves to their environment to not only uncover novel therapeutic targets, but also to learn about the host tissues they colonise.

We have a particular interest in understanding how the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, uses its ubiquitin-proteasome system to sustain development and transmission within human erythrocytes.
